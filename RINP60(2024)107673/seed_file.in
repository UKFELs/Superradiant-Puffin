! PUFFIN SEED FILE
!
!Describes seed fields for input into puffin. Multiple seeds with
!different frequencies, profiles and positions can be used. Please 
!refer to POP-REF for an explanation of the scaled variables used, 
!such as z2.

!PARAMETERS:-
!
!freqf            Ratio of seed to resonant frequency i.e. omega_s / omega_r
!sA0_X                Initial peak field value (real, also the x-polarized field)
!sA0_Y                Initial peak field value (imaginary, also the y-polarized field)
!sSigmaF              Seed field sigma in each spatial direction 
!qFlatTop             =.TRUE. if flat top seed, else gaussian is assumed
!meanZ2               Mean or center position of seed in Z2
!qRndFj_G             round edge of flat top? 
!sSigEj               Sigma of gaussian roll off for flat top
