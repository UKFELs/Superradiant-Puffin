! PUFFIN EXAMPLE BEAM FILE
!
! Describes electron beams for input into puffin. Multiple beams with
! different parameters can be used. Either scaled or S.I. notation
! is used - whether you are using scaled or SI is specified in the 
! 'main' input file. This beam file must contain 2 namelists, one of which
! must be NBLIST.
!
! Please refer to [1] for an explanation of the scaled variables 
! used, such as z2 and p2.

! BEAM TYPE - namelist NBLIST
!
! This namelist chooses which type of beam input is being used. Which type
! is chosen determines what the other namelist in this file should be.
!
!
! Namelist parameters:
!
! dtype - String. Specifies the input type. Options are 'simple' (corresponding
!         to a simple, homogeneous beam with some linear chirp or modulation 
!         added), 'dist' (where many equispaced 'slices' in the temporal/longitudinal 
!         direction are described by homogeneous distribution parameters in every other 
!         direction), or 'h5' (which is an hdf5 file with 6D electron macroparticle 
!         coordinates and charge weights). If 'simple', this file must include the BLIST
!         namelist. if 'dist', this file must include the BDLIST namelist. If 'h5',
!         this file must include the BH5LIST namelist.
! 
! nbeams - Integer. For flexibility, Puffin can create a number of electron beams at once.
!          Use this to tell Puffin how many beams to create if using either the 'simple'
!          or 'dist' input types.

!
! SIMPLE BEAM PARAMETERS - namelist BLIST
!
! This namelist is used to generate a simple Gaussian or Flat-Top beamn distribution
! in Puffin.
!
!
! Namelist Parameters:
!
! sSigmaE - gaussian std dev in each dimension - x, y, z2, px, py, gamma, then for additional beams
! sLenE   - Total length of beam modelled in each dimension - x, y, z2, px, py, gamma...
! bcenter - Center of beam in z2
! iNumMPs  -  Number of macroparticles in each dimension used to model the beam 
! iMPsZ2PerWave - Number of macroparticles per reference wavelength in z2
!                 This overwrites the values given in iNumMPs, if present
! qOneDCold - When in 1D mode, this decides if the beam is completely cold 
!             (zero energy spread when = .true.)
! emitx, emity - Scaled transverse beam emittance
! alphax, alphay - Twiss parameters \alpha_x,y in x and y, respectively
! sQe - Beam charge 
! gammaf - Ratio of average beam energy to reference beam energy gamma / gamma_r 
! chirp  - Energy chirp in z2 (or t) i.e. dgamma/dz2 (or dgamma/dt)
! mag    - magnitude of beam energy oscillation on beam (default = 0)
! freq   - Wavenumber 2 pi / lambda in z2 (or t) of beam energy oscillation
! qRndEj_G - Round edge of flat top? (ignored if not flat-top distribution in
!           the temporal dimension)
! sSigEj_G - Gaussian sigma of tail-off if used
! qMatched_A - Automatically match beam to focusing channel?? The matching is 
!              done to only the 'natural' or strong, constant focusing channel.
!              It is NOT matched to an undulator-quad lattice.

!   This example input file re-creates the results of figure 2 in the following
!   publication:
!
!   B.W.J. McNeil, G.R.M. Robb and D.A. Jaroszynski, Opt. Comm. Vol 165, pp 65-70
!
!   The example models an electron beam with a 'flat-top', rectangular current
!   distribution radiating strong Coherent Spontaneous Emission (CSE) from its sharp
!   edges in an undulator, which is then amplified in a superradiant type spike
!   in a long undulator. This is known as Self-Amplified Coherent Spontaneous 
!   Emission (SACSE). This is shown in 1D mode.


!   We choose a single, simple beam distribution.

&NBLIST
nbeams = 1
dtype = 'simple'
/

!   We then specify the simple beam distribution:
!
!   Using a sSigmaE of 1E8 in the temporal dimension (the 3rd element) results
!   in a flat-top distribution, with length given by sLenE (again, the 3rd 
!   element). Here, this is in scaled units, which are units of lc, the FEL
!   cooperation length.
!
!   For this example, note that qFixCharge = .true. - this adjusts the charge 
!   so that the beam has the same FEL parameter 'rho' as in the main input file.
